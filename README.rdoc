OpinioNation is an online community that connects people who have questions with people who have answers. The mantra of OpinioNation is: "Ask a question. Give an answer. Get involved." The site favors visual, bite-sized, fun, lightweight engagement.

OpinioNation was designed with a mobile-first approach so it looks great on your phone. The app was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails (serving primarily as the API layer), and PostgreSQL.
